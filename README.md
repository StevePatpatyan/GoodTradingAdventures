This game was made to be integrated with my [GoodTradingBot](https://github.com/StevePatpatyan/GoodTradingCardBot) to bring another fun way to earn cards. The game consists of "adventures" I created. When entering a username and an icon, the user can choose an adventure. After completing an adventure, the user should get a result message they can screenshot to then send proof to the owner using the adventure_proof command in the bot DM's!

The variables and functions are modularized nicely into their respective adventure scenes.py

**Another way of implementing this for better automation and connectivity is through a separate backend/configured API which connects the game real-time to your bot. Not done here.**

**Thank you to LPC Generator for character sprite generation. All of the individual artwork credits are included in the CREDITS.csv file**

**Thank you to Chequered Ink for the tileset and buildings used in Detective PK and the Super Bowl Scandal. (Check their assets out here.)[https://ci.itch.io/all-game-assets].**

I am including my own custom-made adventures here. However, you may take inspiration from this and make your own for the/a bot.
